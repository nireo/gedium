# go-blog-api
A fully featured blogging site inspired by medium. It has many of the features a blog based social media app would need. I has a fully featured editor with a code editor and proper text editor. The whole app is quite simple, since it only uses a barebones css library and only a few dependencies.

## Features
This is a small list of those features the user might appreciate. Of course, there are a lot of different features on the back-end.
* Fully featured editor
* Follow functionality
* Authentication
* User created topics

## Preview
The app isn't currently hosted anywhere but in the future it might be.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to the project by creating a pull request. Make sure you include a reason for why you deem the change necessar.
